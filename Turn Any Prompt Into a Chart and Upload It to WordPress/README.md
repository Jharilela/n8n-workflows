# Overview 

This workflow takes a prompt, searches the web for relevant data and generate a chart using chart.js . The workflow then uploads the image to wordpress to be used as a CDN image delivery for your blog. I personally use this workflow as a mcp tool when generating blog posts

This workflow is also published on the [main n8n.io website](https://n8n.io/workflows/6361-ai-powered-chart-generation-from-web-data-with-gpt-4o-and-wordpress-upload/)

## AI-Powered Chart Generation from Web Data 

This n8n workflow automates the process of:
1. **Scraping real-time data from the web** using GPT-4o with browsing capability
2. **Converting markdown tables into Chart.js-compatible JSON**
3. **Rendering the chart** using [QuickChart.io](https://quickchart.io)
4. **Uploading the resulting image** directly to your WordPress media library

## üöÄ Use Case

Ideal for content creators, analysts, or automation engineers who need to:
- Automate generation of visual reports
- Create marketing-ready charts from live data
- Streamline research-to-publish workflows

---

## üß† How It Works

### 1. Prompt Input
Trigger the workflow manually or via another workflow with a `prompt` string, e.g.:

Generate a graph of apple's market share in the mobile phone market in Q1 2025


---

### 2. Web Search + Table Extraction
The `Message a model` node uses GPT-4o with search to:
- Perform a real-time query
- Extract data into a markdown table
- Return the raw table + citation URLs

---

### 3. Chart Generation via AI Agent
The `Generate Chart AI Agent`:
- Interprets the table
- Picks an appropriate chart type (bar, line, doughnut, etc.)
- Outputs valid Chart.js JSON using a strict schema

---

### 4. QuickChart API Integration
The `Create QuickChart` node:
- Sends the Chart.js config to QuickChart.io
- Renders the chart into a PNG image

---

### 5. WordPress Image Upload
The `Upload image` node:
- Uploads the PNG to your WordPress media library using REST API
- Uses proper headers for filename and content-type
- Returns the media GUID and full image URL

---

## üß© Nodes Used

- `Manual Trigger` or `Execute Workflow Trigger`
- `OpenAI Chat Model` (GPT-4o)
- `LangChain Agent` (Chart Generator)
- `LangChain OutputParserStructured`
- `HTTP Request` (QuickChart API + WordPress Upload)
- `Code` (Final result formatting)

---

## üóÇ Output Format

The final `Code` node returns:
```json
{
  "research": { ...raw markdown table + citations... },
  "graph_data": { ...Chart.js JSON... },
  "graph_image": { ...WordPress upload metadata... },
  "result_image_url": "https://your-wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/...png"
}
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
OpenAI credentials (GPT-4o or GPT-4o-mini)

WordPress REST API credentials with media write access

QuickChart.io (free tier works)

n8n v1.25+ recommended

## üìå Notes
Chart style and format are determined dynamically based on your table structure and AI interpretation.

Make sure your OpenAI and WordPress credentials are connected properly.

Outputs are schema-validated to ensure reliable rendering.
