# 🤖 Reddit Auto-Comment Assistant (AI-Driven Marketing Workflow)

Automate how you reply to Reddit posts using **AI-generated, first-person comments** that sound human, follow subreddit rules, and (optionally) promote your own links or products.

---

## 🧩 Overview

This workflow monitors Reddit mentions (via **F5Bot Gmail alerts**) and automatically:
1. Fetches the relevant Reddit post.  
2. Checks the subreddit’s rules for self-promotion.  
3. Generates a comment using GPT-5 style prompting (human-like tone, <255 chars).  
4. Optionally promotes your chosen product from Google Sheets.  
5. Posts the comment automatically and logs results to Discord and Google Sheets.

It’s ideal for creators, marketers, or founders who want to grow awareness **organically and authentically** on Reddit — without sounding like a bot.
