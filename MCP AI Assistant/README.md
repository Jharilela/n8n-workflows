## ‚úÖ Key Capabilities

- **AI Agent + Tool Use**: Built using n8n's AI Agent and MCP system, enabling intelligent multi-step reasoning.
- **Tool Integration**:
  - Google Calendar: schedule, update, delete events
  - Gmail: search, draft, send emails
  - Google Drive: manage files and folders
  - LinkedIn & Twitter: post updates, send DMs
  - Utility tools: fetch date/time, search URLs
- **Discord Input**: Accepts prompts via `n8n_discord_trigger_bot` [repo link](https://github.com/Jharilela/n8n_discord_trigger_bot)

## üõ† Setup Instructions

1. **Timezone Configuration**:
   - Go to `Settings &gt; Default Timezone` in n8n.
   - Set to your local timezone (e.g., `Asia/Jakarta`).
   - Ensure all `Date & Time` nodes explicitly use the same zone to avoid UTC-related bugs.

2. **Tool Authentication**:
   - Replace all OAuth credentials for:
     - Gmail
     - Google Drive
     - Google Calendar
     - Twitter
     - LinkedIn
   - Use your own accounts when copying this workflow.

3. **Platform Adaptability**:
   - While designed for Discord, you can replace the Discord trigger with any other chat or webhook service.
   - Example: Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp Webhook, n8n Form Trigger, etc.

## üì¶ Strengths

- Great for **document retrieval**, **email summarization**, **calendar scheduling**, and **social posting**.
- Reduces the need for tab-switching across multiple platforms.
- Tested with a comprehensive checklist across categories like:
  - Calendar
  - Gmail
  - Google Drive
  - Twitter
  - LinkedIn
  - Utility tools
  - Cross-tool actions  
  (Refer to [prompt checklist](https://github.com/Jharilela/n8n-workflows/blob/main/MCP%20AI%20Assistant/prompt%20checklist.md) for prompt coverage.)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- ‚ùå **Binary Uploads**:
  - AI agents & MCP server currently struggle with binary payloads.
  - Uploading files to Gmail, Google Drive, or LinkedIn may fail due to format serialization issues.
  - Binary operations (upload/post) are **under development** and will be fixed in future iterations.

- ‚ùå **Date Bugs**:
  - If timezone settings are incorrect, event times may default to UTC, leading to misaligned calendar events.

## üî¨ Testing

Use the provided prompt checklist for full coverage of:
- ‚úÖ Core feature flows
- ‚úÖ Edge cases (e.g., invalid dates, nonexistent users)
- ‚úÖ Cross-tool chains (e.g., Google Drive ‚Üí Gmail ‚Üí LinkedIn)
